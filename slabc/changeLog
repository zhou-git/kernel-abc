0.0-5 

* adds another env+stoch variant of blowfly model, required by referee.

0.0-4

* added routines for blowfly model with pure demographic 
  stochasticity. See ?ds.bf. 

0.0-3

* More principled approach to noise in the blowfly models ---
  no evidence that AR useful, but multiplicative  log-normal structure 
  is a bit weird, biologically, and could bias inference (albeit towards 
  the stable region). 

0.0-2

* added routines get.trans and trans.stats to aid transfromation of 
  stats to marginal normality

* modified blowfly.ll so that it can operate with any 
  of the blowfly datasets.

* added chain2ll to NAMESPACE 

* added Nicholson 1954 datasets (three)
