## slabc
Rejection/Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm on dynamic ecology system. 
### enviroment
R.
To use this package, compile the package and load it into R. The ricker_sequential.R provide the script for the experiments showed in the paper.

## QueueSMC
Rejection/Sequential Monte Carlo on M/G/1 queue model.
### enviroment
Matlab.
queSMC.m is the main scripts for original ABC algorithm.
queSMC_gkdr/queSMC_semi are the corresponding algorithms shown in the paper.

## msmodel
Rejection algorithm on Coalescent model of populational genetics.
### enviroment
Matlab/C
File names are similar to the QueueSMC.
